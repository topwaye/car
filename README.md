# CAR : Computer Aided Read

how to read files with thousands of lines of code. it will take you decades to read them all

is there a way to quickly finish reading them? only a prodigy can manage to do it, but most of us are not prodigies

for most of us, reading tens of thousands of lines of code is a mission we are destined never to complete in our lifetime

are most of us destined to be mediocre? are most of us doomed to achieve nothing? why do most of us come into this world, only to live a mediocre life?

is there any way to change all of this? the weak monkeys took over the world from the powerful dinosaurs because of their intelligence

perhaps this program can help you fulfill your wish, quickly reading through files with thousands of lines of code, at least for script files, this is the case, for example, PHP files

this programme automatically inserts tracing source code into all PHP files, so that a tracing report is generated when the PHP files run, then this tracking report will be processed sequentially by this program, generating a directory tree on the disk

this directory tree contains all the files used in a single PHP execution scope which is exactly what we want to know

this is how we can quickly understand PHP projects with thousands of lines of code

this programme is written in C language and compiled with Visual Studio 2022

this programme reimplements part of regular expressions, using a recursive algorithm, 
referring to a book by the author of regular expressions, Beautiful Code
